# Fee Management System
- Computer Science Project (Python)
- CBSE – Class XII (2021–2022)


# Project Overview

This project is a Fee Management System developed as a Class 12 Computer Science Project during the academic year 2021–2022.

The main aim of this project is to provide a simple and user-friendly system to manage student fee records digitally instead of using manual registers. The system allows adding, viewing, and managing student fee details efficiently.

In the present digital age, computer-based systems are widely used to store, manage, and process information efficiently. Educational institutions also require proper systems to manage student records, especially fee-related data.

This project titled “Fee Management System” has been developed as a Class XII Computer Science project for the academic session 2021–2022. The project is designed using the Python programming language with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to manage student fee records in a simple and systematic manner.

The system helps in maintaining fee details of students digitally, thereby reducing manual paperwork and chances of error.


# Objectives

- To reduce manual work in fee record management
- To store student fee details in a structured way
- To provide a simple graphical user interface (GUI)
- To understand real-world application development using Python


# Learning Outcomes

- Basics of Python programming
- GUI development using PyQt
- Understanding of software versioning
- Practical exposure to application development


# Conclusion

The Fee Management System successfully fulfills the objectives of the project. It provides a simple and effective way to manage student fee records digitally. This project helped in understanding how computer applications can be used to solve real-world problems in an educational environment.
